## Issues

Please feel free to report an issue for bugs, and any other problems you
encounter with the MCP Gateway project.

### Process

We have some light process around issue management that contributors should
be aware of: We organize via [GitHub milestones], which are collected into
a roadmap. We use [GitHub project boards] to track the milestones and issues.
Milestones are sequential.

We provide some labels to indicate individual issue priorities based on
impact and time-sensitivity:

* `priority/low` - Low-impact and little time-sensitivity. Can be worked on
  after other issues have been accounted for.
* `priority/normal` - Standard, default priority for issues. Can be worked on
  after higher priority items are finished, and before any low priority items.
* `priority/high` - High-impact, may affect many other issues, and may be very
  time-sensitive. Should accounted for before non-critical issues.
* `priority/critical` - Indicates an extremely time-sensitive and/or extremely
  high impact critical issues. Interrupts other work until it is accounted for,
  and should be used sparingly.

### Triage

We have some light automation and process around triaging issues. This process
is centered around milestones:

1. When issues don't have a milestone: they are considered "in need of triage",
   so the maintainers can review and decide whether they will be accepted, and
   if so which milestone they belong to.
2. When issues have a milestone: they are considered `triage/accepted`, and
   need a priority. The priority will default to `priority/normal`.
