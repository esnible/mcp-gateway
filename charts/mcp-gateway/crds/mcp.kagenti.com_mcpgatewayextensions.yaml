          MCPGatewayExtension extends a Gateway API Gateway to handle the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
          When created, the controller will:
          - Deploy a broker-router Deployment and Service in the MCPGatewayExtension's namespace
          - Create an EnvoyFilter in the Gateway's namespace to route MCP traffic to the broker
          - Configure the Envoy proxy to use the external processor for MCP request handling

          The broker aggregates tools from upstream MCP servers registered via MCPServerRegistration
          resources, while the router handles MCP protocol parsing and request routing.

          Cross-namespace references to Gateways require a ReferenceGrant in the Gateway's namespace.
