# Getting Started

**Want to try MCP Gateway on Kubernetes and connect your first MCP servers?** Start here: **[Installation Guide](./how-to-install-and-configure.md)**

<!-- do we want to update the install guide by either marking out every way to install except Helm, or by breaking into install types? we would also break config into a separate doc if we go this route -->

## Essential Setup

- [Installation and Configuration](./how-to-install-and-configure.md) - Get MCP Gateway running
- [Configure Gateway Routing](./configure-mcp-gateway-listener-and-router.md) - Set up traffic routing
- [Configure MCP Servers](./register-mcp-servers.md) - Connect internal servers
- [External MCP Servers](./external-mcp-server.md) - Connect to external APIs

## Advanced Features

- [Authentication](./authentication.md) - OAuth-based security
- [Authorization](./authorization.md) - Fine-grained access control
- [Virtual MCP Servers](./virtual-mcp-servers.md) - Focused tool collections
<!-- - [Standalone Installation](./guides/binary-install.md) - Non-Kubernetes deployment -->
<!-- do we want non-OCP setup in the docs at this stage? -->
- [Vault Integration](./vault-integration.md)
- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
