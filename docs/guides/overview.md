# MCP Gateway Overview

Centralize and manage the connectivity for agentic AI applications that access your Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gateway.

## Why use the MCP Gateway

By using the MCP Gateway, you can focus on your agentic AI systems without building networking into your application code.

- Aggregate MCP servers behind a single endpoint.
- Grow your agentic AI applications at scale.
- Manage access to and the security of AI tools and MCP servers.

## How it works

This MCP gateway extends the benefits of the Envoy proxy server to your customized AI agent systems that require data or need to perform actions based on the data or functions contained in your backend MCP servers. Envoy intercepts all network traffic and is a conformance-tested implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API.

## Early preview feature

The MCP Gateway is an early preview feature. This early preview feature is not complete or production-ready. This early preview feature gives you access so that you can experiment with functionality and give feedback during the development process. This feature is subject to change or removal at any time. Testing is limited.
